                <h2>About Peanut</h2>
                <p>
                    Peanut was caught outside near an old shelter with another 
                    bunny. Both were adopted separately. Peanut was surrendered 
                    back in Sept '24 when his family got a second bun and he 
                    became aggressive towards the new bun. This is why using our 
                    bonding services is helpful! Bonding bunnies is NOT easy! 
                    Personality: Cute ball of fluff.
