                    Zephyr is a tortoiseshell & domestic long hair mix kitten 
                    with a medium built. She is affectionate, curious, friendly, 
                    funny, gentle, loving, playful, and smart. She has a short 
                    coat. Her vaccinations are up to date, and she has been 
                    spayed / neutered.

                <h2>Meet Zephyr</h2>
                <p>
                    Zephyr, gentle as a warm breeze, is a shy wee girl with a 
                    sleek tortoise shell coat and beautiful dark golden eyes. 
                    Her foster mom says she is becoming braver everyday. She 
                    purrs with gentle pets and takes part in the rough and 
                    tumble play of her four litter mates. She will need a 
                    patient caregiver who lets her socialize at her own pace. 
                    She's already made great strides in foster care, learning to 
                    trust humans. Zephyr is 4 lb and roughly 4 months old at 
                    Halloween. She loves to watch the birds, lizards, chipmunks 
                    and squirrels outside the windows in the garden. With 
                    patience and support, her courage should build, watching her 
                    siblings accept humans and the loving care of her foster 
                    mom. She was part of a litter that was trapped as feral 
                    kittens and brought into foster in early October. She hasn't 
                    been tested around dogs or young children; she's still 
                    sensitive to sudden movements or loud noises.
