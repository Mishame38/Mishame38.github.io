        </ul>    
        <p>CREAM FOAM (OPTIONAL)<p>
            <ul>    
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li> 2 to 3 tablespoons whole or 2% milk</li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>        
            <p>OTHER TOPPINGS</p>
            <ul>
                <li>mini marshmallows</li>
                <li>matcha powder, to sprinkle on top</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>
            <ol>
                <p>    
                    <li>
                        Prepare the White Hot Cocoa: In a medium saucepan over 
                        low to medium heat, combine the milk, white 
                        chocolate, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. 
                        Stir constantly until the chocolate is fully melted 
                        and the mixture is smooth and hot, but avoid 
                        boiling. Set aside.
                    </li>     
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Make the Matcha: Add warm water into a mixing bowl. 
                        Sift the matcha powder on top to avoid clumps. Whisk 
                        all together until smooth and frothy, using a 
                        bamboo whisk or small electric whisk in an M or W  
                        motion.
                    </li>    
                </p>        
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Assemble: Pour the white hot cocoa into serving cups, 
                        filling each about two-thirds of the way. Add a 
                        matcha shot on top, gently stirring to create a    
                        beautiful swirl.
                    </li>    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Top with Cream Foam or Marshmallows (Optional): For the 
                        cream foam, whisk heavy cream with a splash of milk, 
                        vanilla extract, and sugar until thick but not 
                        stiff; avoid overwhipping. Spoon a dollop of this 
                        soft foam over each drink and sift matcha powder on 
                        top. Alternatively, top with mini marshmallows and 
                        carefully toast them with a kitchen torch until 
                        golden brown for a toasty finish.
                    </li>    
                </p>        
            </ol>
