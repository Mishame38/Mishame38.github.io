        <h4>Synopsis</h4> 
        <p>
            "The Little Mermaid" is visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall's 
            live-action reimagining of Disney's beloved animated musical 
            classic, the story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid 
            with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton's daughters
            and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world 
            beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the 
            dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with 
            humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil 
            sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on 
            land but ultimately places her life and her father's crown in 
            jeopardy. “The Little Mermaid” is directed by Rob Marshall with a 
            screenplay by David Magee, and is produced by Marc Platt, Lin-Manuel 
            Miranda, John DeLuca and Rob Marshall.
